Usage of four Kinect v4 Azure depth sensors and a modified version of the demonstration
by RF Solutions Inc. with our own virtual environments to track multiple people and
map their motion into multiple avatars in our environments.

The virtual environments were created in Unity 2018.4.11f1.

Below are a couple of brief examples of the tracking and avatar motion.
These include the virtual environments in various labs and hallway in our building.

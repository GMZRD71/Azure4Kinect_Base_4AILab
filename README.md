 Azure for Kinect and Unity Integration Files
 
This is an example of how to use the Azure Kinect Examples Develope by RF Solutions Inc. and track multiple human skeletons and view the tracked skeletons in a virtual environment created in Unity.  A simulate school laboratory was created and one Azure Kinect DK device was used to track bodies and display their movements with avatars in the virtual room in real-time.
